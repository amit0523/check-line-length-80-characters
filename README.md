This program takes a file as an argument (only one file) and then reads this
file line by line and checks whether the length of the lines is at most 80
characters or not. If some line's length is more than 80 characters then the
line number is printed on the output screen. Also, the total number of lines
having more than 80 characters is also printed at the end of the output.

The bash script (print_random_length_ascii_lines.sh) prints 1000 ascii lines
having random lengths. You can use this script to create a test file to test
this program. You can also change this script according to your requirements.
